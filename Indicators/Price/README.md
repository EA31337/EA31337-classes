# Price indicators

Price indicators in Forex are a specific category of technical indicators that
generate a single price value as their output.
These indicators focus on analyzing and representing specific aspects of price data
to provide insights into market trends, momentum, or other relevant information.

These price indicators are commonly used to identify trends, support and resistance levels,
and potential entry or exit points in the market.
By focusing on the single price value generated by these indicators,
traders can gain insights into the overall price direction
based on the average price over a specific period
and make informed trading decisions.

Popular examples of price indicators include:

- Moving Average (MA):
  A widely used price indicator that calculates the average price over a specified period.
  It smoothes out price fluctuations and provides a single value that represents the average price.

- DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average):
  Similar to a traditional moving average, DEMA applies a double smoothing technique
  to provide a single price value.
  It aims to reduce lag and provide more responsive signals compared to standard moving averages.

## AMA (Adaptive Moving Average)

The Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is a technical indicator designed to adjust
its sensitivity to market conditions. Unlike traditional moving averages that
use fixed periods, the AMA dynamically adapts to changing volatility, aiming
to provide more accurate signals.

The AMA adjusts its smoothing factor based on market volatility. When the
market is more volatile, the indicator becomes more responsive and follows
price movements closely. Conversely, during periods of low volatility, the AMA
becomes less sensitive, reducing the impact of minor price fluctuations.

The calculation of the AMA involves several steps. It begins with calculating
the Efficiency Ratio (ER), which measures the efficiency of price movement.
The ER compares the absolute value of the current price's change to the sum of
the absolute values of all price changes over a specified period. The ER
ranges between 0 and 1.

Next, the Smoothing Constant (SC) is calculated by applying a formula to the
ER. The SC determines the degree of smoothing applied to the AMA. A higher SC
value results in less smoothing, making the AMA more responsive to recent
price changes.

Finally, the AMA is computed by multiplying the current price's difference
from the previous AMA value by the SC and adding it to the previous AMA value.
This process is repeated for each subsequent data point.

The Adaptive Moving Average aims to provide more accurate signals by adjusting
its responsiveness to prevailing market conditions. It can help traders
identify trends, support and resistance levels, and potential entry or exit
points. By adapting to changing market dynamics, the AMA attempts to minimize
false signals and enhance the effectiveness of moving average-based
strategies.

It's worth noting that the specific formulas and parameters used in
calculating the AMA may vary based on the implementation and platform being
used. Traders should carefully review the settings and methodology of the
specific AMA indicator they intend to use.

In summary, the Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) is a technical indicator that
dynamically adjusts its sensitivity to market conditions. It aims to provide
more accurate signals by adapting to changes in volatility. The AMA can assist
traders in identifying trends and potential entry or exit points. Its
flexibility makes it a popular choice among those seeking a moving average
that can adapt to varying market conditions.

## DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average)

The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is a technical indicator that aims
to reduce lag and provide more responsive signals compared to traditional moving
averages. It accomplishes this by applying a double smoothing technique to the
price data.

The calculation of the DEMA involves two steps. First, a regular exponential
moving average (EMA) is calculated using a specified period. The EMA calculates
the average price by assigning more weight to recent data points.

Next, a second EMA is calculated on the previously calculated EMA values, again
using the same period. This second EMA smooths the EMA values further, resulting
in a double-smoothed average.

The DEMA formula subtracts twice the second EMA from the first EMA to derive the
DEMA value. This calculation aims to provide a faster and more responsive moving
average line compared to traditional single-smoothed moving averages.

The DEMA indicator attempts to identify trend reversals and generate trading
signals. When the DEMA line starts to rise, it suggests a bullish trend, while a
declining DEMA line indicates a bearish trend. Traders may look for crossovers
between the DEMA line and the price to generate buy or sell signals.

The DEMA indicator is known for its ability to reduce lag and provide smoother
responses to price movements. However, it can also be more susceptible to false
signals during choppy or ranging market conditions. Traders often use the DEMA
in combination with other technical indicators or as part of a broader trading
strategy to confirm signals and enhance accuracy.

In summary, the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is a technical
indicator that applies a double smoothing technique to price data. It aims to
reduce lag and provide more responsive signals compared to traditional moving
averages. The DEMA is used to identify trend reversals and generate trading
signals. Traders often use it in conjunction with other indicators and analysis
techniques to enhance their trading strategies.

## MA (Moving Average)

The Moving Average (MA) indicator is one of the most widely used and basic
technical analysis tools. It aims to smooth out price fluctuations and
identify trends by calculating the average price over a specified period.

The MA indicator is calculated by adding up the closing prices of a financial
instrument over a designated number of periods and dividing the sum by the
number of periods. For example, a simple moving average (SMA) of 20 periods
would sum up the closing prices of the last 20 periods and divide the sum by 20.

As new data points become available, the MA value is recalculated by dropping
the oldest data point and adding the most recent one. This process creates a
moving average line that trails the price action.

The MA indicator helps traders visualize the overall direction and smooth out
short-term price fluctuations. It is commonly used to identify support and
resistance levels, as well as potential entry and exit points. When the price is
above the moving average, it suggests a bullish trend, and when the price is
below the moving average, it indicates a bearish trend.

Different types of moving averages can be used, such as the simple moving
average (SMA) that evenly weighs all data points, or exponential moving average
(EMA) that places more weight on recent prices. Traders choose the type of
moving average based on their trading strategies and preferences.

Crossovers between different moving averages are often analyzed to generate
trading signals. For example, a bullish signal may occur when a shorter-term
moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, indicating a
potential upward trend reversal. Conversely, a bearish signal may occur when a
shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average,
suggesting a potential downward trend reversal.

In summary, the Moving Average (MA) indicator calculates the average price
over a specified period to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends.
It is widely used to determine support and resistance levels, as well as
generate entry and exit signals. Traders often rely on moving averages in
combination with other indicators and analysis techniques to make informed
trading decisions.
