# Price indicators

Price indicators in Forex are a specific category of technical indicators that
generate a single price value as their output.
These indicators focus on analyzing and representing specific aspects of price data
to provide insights into market trends, momentum, or other relevant information.

These price indicators are commonly used to identify trends, support and resistance levels,
and potential entry or exit points in the market.
By focusing on the single price value generated by these indicators,
traders can gain insights into the overall price direction
based on the average price over a specific period
and make informed trading decisions.

Popular examples of price indicators include:

- Moving Average (MA):
  A widely used price indicator that calculates the average price over a specified period.
  It smoothes out price fluctuations and provides a single value that represents the average price.

- DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average):
  Similar to a traditional moving average, DEMA applies a double smoothing technique
  to provide a single price value.
  It aims to reduce lag and provide more responsive signals compared to standard moving averages.
