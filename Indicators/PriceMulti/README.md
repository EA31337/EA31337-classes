# Price Multi indicators

Price multi indicators are a specific type of technical indicators in the Forex market
that generate multiple price values as their outputs.
These indicators go beyond providing a single value and offer a range of price information,
typically representing different aspects of price behavior.

One example is the Alligator indicator developed by Bill Williams.
It consists of three lines, known as the jaw, teeth, and lips,
which mimic the structure of an alligator.
Each line represents a moving average with specific parameters and is shifted forward in time.
The values of these lines change as new price data is incorporated,
reflecting the dynamics of the market.

These type of indicators provide traders with a more comprehensive perspective
on price movements by offering multiple price values instead of a single value.
This can help traders make more informed decisions
by considering different aspects of price behavior simultaneously.

In summary, price multi indicators in Forex produce multiple price values as their outputs,
providing a broader view of price behavior.
These indicators offer traders a more comprehensive understanding of the market
and can assist in identifying trends and potential trading opportunities.
