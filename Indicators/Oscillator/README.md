# Oscillator indicators

Oscillators are a category of technical indicators used in financial markets analysis.
They are designed to identify overbought or oversold conditions and potential trend reversals.
Oscillators typically oscillate within a specific range or between certain values,
indicating the momentum or strength of a price movement.

Oscillators are considered a subset of indicators since they are technical tools
used to analyze price data and generate signals.
They differ from other types of indicators
like trend-following or volume-based indicators
because oscillators are designed to provide information
about the short-term price behavior rather than long-term trends or volume patterns.

Common examples of oscillators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI),
Stochastic Oscillator, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and the Williams %R.
These indicators generate values that fluctuate within predefined boundaries,
typically between 0 and 100 or -100 and +100,
indicating the relative strength or weakness of price movements.

Traders and analysts use oscillators to identify potential buying or selling opportunities,
divergences, and to gauge market conditions such as overbought or oversold levels.
They can be helpful in identifying potential trend reversals or determining the strength of an ongoing trend.

In summary, oscillators are a type of indicator used in technical analysis
that measure price momentum and provide insights into overbought or oversold conditions.
They are considered a subset of indicators due to their specific function and characteristics.

## ASI (Accumulation Swing Index) indicator

The Accumulation Swing Index (ASI) is a technical indicator that aims to gauge
the strength and direction of a market's price movement.
It combines price action and volume to provide insights into market trends
and potential reversals. The ASI calculates a running cumulative total,
incorporating the relationship between the current close, previous close,
and recent price ranges.

The ASI starts with an initial value, typically zero, and then factors
in price and volume data. If the current close is higher than the previous close,
the indicator adds a fraction of the current range (high minus low)
to the prior ASI value. Conversely, if the current close is lower,
a fraction of the current range is subtracted.
The fraction is determined based on the volume and price relationship.

The ASI's cumulative total fluctuates, reflecting the strength of price movements.
Rising ASI values indicate buying pressure and potential uptrends,
while falling values suggest selling pressure and potential downtrends.
Traders often analyze the ASI for divergences from price action,
which can signal shifts in market sentiment.

The ASI is typically plotted as a line chart.
Positive values above zero indicate accumulation or buying pressure,
while negative values below zero indicate distribution or selling pressure.
The crossover of the ASI line with zero may be considered a signal
for potential trend reversals.

It's important to note that the ASI does not provide specific
buy or sell signals on its own. Traders commonly use it in conjunction
with other technical analysis tools and indicators
to validate trading decisions and identify potential entry or exit points.

In summary, it is a technical indicator that combines price action
and volume to assess market strength and direction.
It calculates a running cumulative total based on the relationship
between current and previous prices, incorporating price ranges.

## MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator

MACD measures the relationship between two moving averages
of an asset's price. It consists of a MACD line and a signal line.
The MACD histogram represents the difference between the MACD line
and the signal line and provides insights into the momentum of the trend.

## RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator

RSI compares the magnitude of recent price gains to recent price losses
to determine if an asset is overbought or oversold.
It oscillates between 0 and 100,
with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions
and values below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

## Stochastic indicator

The Stochastic Oscillator compares the closing price of an asset
to its price range over a specific period.
It generates values between 0 and 100,
where readings above 80 suggest overbought conditions,
and readings below 20 indicate oversold conditions.

## WPR (Williams Percent Range)

WPR indicator is a momentum oscillator developed by Larry Williams.
It is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market
and potential trend reversals.
The WPR indicator oscillates between -100 and 0,
with readings above -20 considered overbought
and readings below -80 considered oversold.

The WPR indicator calculates the percentage of the difference
between the current closing price and the highest high over a specified period,
relative to the difference between the highest high
and the lowest low over the same period.
The formula is then inverted and multiplied by -100 to obtain the WPR value.

When the WPR indicator reaches or exceeds the -20 level,
it suggests that the market is overbought,
meaning the price may have risen too far too quickly,
and a reversal or correction may occur.
Conversely, when the WPR indicator falls to or below the -80 level,
it indicates oversold conditions, implying that the price may have declined
too rapidly and could potentially reverse to the upside.
