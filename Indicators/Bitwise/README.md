# Bitwise indicators

Bitwise indicators are a specialized category of technical indicators
in which information is stored and represented using binary bits instead of numerical values.
These indicators utilize a binary system,
with each bit representing a specific condition or pattern that is being analyzed.

One example of a bitwise indicator is the Pattern indicator.
This indicator focuses on identifying various chart patterns,
such as bullish or bearish candles, doji patterns,
double top or bottom formations, reversals, or other candlestick patterns.
Instead of providing numerical values or calculations,
the Pattern indicator uses activation bits to store information
about the presence or absence of specific chart patterns.

When a particular pattern is detected and considered active,
the corresponding bit or bits associated with that pattern are set to "1" (as active).
Conversely, if the pattern is not present or not active,
the associated bits are set to "0" (as inactive).

By using the Pattern indicator or similar bitwise indicators,
traders can streamline their analysis and focus on specific patterns
that may indicate potential trading opportunities.

By using bitwise representation, the Bitwise indicators can efficiently store information
about multiple conditions within a compact binary format.
Traders can then interpret the activated bits to identify
and analyze the occurrence of specific conditions in the market.

These bitwise indicators can be helpful for traders who rely on pattern recognition
and want to automate the identification process.

In summary, bitwise indicators in Forex utilize binary bits
to store and represent information about specific conditions or patterns.
This allows traders to efficiently automate pattern recognition and enhance their trading analysis.
