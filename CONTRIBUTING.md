### Submitting A Bug Report

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
After you've determined which repository your bug is related to,
create an issue on that repository and provide the details.

## Code

### Compatibility

We aim at syntax compatibility with 3 languages at once: MQL4, MQL5 and C++.

### Coding conventions

To optimize the code for readability, please follow these guidelines:

* Indent using two spaces (soft tabs).
* Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

We use a `clang-format` code formatter tool to format the code
(both MQL and C++ files).

For example, to format file inplace, run:

    clang-format -i File.mqh

### Syntax

To improve code compatibility, please use the following syntax:

| MQL               | C++                     | Syntax to use              |
|:------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
| `&this`           | `this`                  | `THIS_PTR`                 |
| `GetPointer(obj)` | `*obj`                  | `GET_PTR(obj)`             |
| `T name[]`        | `_cpp_array<T> name`    | `ARRAY(T, name)`           |
| `T<A, B> N[]`     | `_cpp_array<T<A, B>> N` | `ARRAY(T<A, B>, N)`        |
| `obj.Method()`    | `obj->Method()`         | `obj PTR_DEREF Method()`   |
| `obj.a1.a2`       | `obj->a1->a2`           | `PTR_ATTRIB2(obj, a1, a2)` |
| `obj.attr`        | `obj->attr`             | `PTR_ATTRIB(obj, attr)`    |
| `str == NULL`     | `str == NULL`           | `IsNull(str)`              |
